# Super Smash ÆÜGH
A simple game made in SFML and C++ that involves an arrow key controlled pufferfish. The pufferfish has to eat food around the map while being chased by Gordon Ramsay. The game is currently in development, but it is playable.

### Controls:
* Arrow keys to control pufferfish
* ESC to pause.

### Build dependencies:
* SFML 2.5.1 (this is the one on my system; you can probably get away with an older one)
* xxd
