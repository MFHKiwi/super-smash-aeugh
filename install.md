Super Smash Aeugh Install Instructions:

Before installation, ensure you have sfml and clang - or alternatives that work in the same way depending on your distro. Super Smash Aeugh only supports Linux systems.


First time install + run instructions:

1. cd [directory] (e.g. cd /home/MFHKiwi/Documents)
2. git clone https://github.com/MFHKiwi/super-smash-aeugh/new/main (YOU WILL HAVE TO INSTALL GIT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!)
3. cd [directory] (e.g. cd /home/MFHKiwi/Documents/super-smash-aeugh)
4. makepkg -si
5. ./super-smash-aeugh


To run in future after installation:

1. cd [directory] (e.g. cd /home/MFHKiwi/Documents/super-smash-aeugh)
2. ./super-smash-aeugh

An executable will most likely be added in the future.


Thank You For Installing And Playing Super Smash Aeugh!
